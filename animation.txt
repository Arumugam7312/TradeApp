You are getting an error with AOS animation because you are including the AOS script and initialization outside of the Vue component system. In Vue (especially Vue 3 + Vite), you should import and initialize AOS inside your component's script, not with <script src="..."> in the SFC file.

How to fix:

1.Install AOS via npm:

command ---> npm install aos

2.Import and initialize AOS in your component: Replace your current script section with the following:

<script setup>
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'
import AOS from 'aos'
import 'aos/dist/aos.css'

onMounted(() => {
  AOS.init({
    duration: 1000,
    once: true
  })
})
</script>
